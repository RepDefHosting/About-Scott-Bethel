As someone who has worked in the real estate industry for many years, I've seen a lot of changes in what people are looking for in terms of short-term rental properties. One trend that has become increasingly clear in recent years is that there is a growing need for short-term housing options for a variety of different professions. This includes technology professionals, travelling healthcare workers, and tradesmen.

The modern workforce is more mobile than ever before, with many people moving from city to city or even country to country for work. This means that there is a growing need for short-term housing options that are affordable, comfortable, and convenient. One group that is particularly in need of this type of accommodation is technology professionals.
