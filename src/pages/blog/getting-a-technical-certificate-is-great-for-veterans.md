As a military veteran, transitioning from military to civilian life can be a challenge. One of the biggest points of uncertainty is finding employment that matches the skills and experience gained during military service. This is where technical certifications come in. Certifications make everyone’s resume stand out. But they are especially beneficial for veterans who bring a lot of practical skills to the civilian marketplace. In this article, I will discuss why getting a technical certificate is great for veterans, how certification training is one way to transition from military life, and how certification training helps veterans determine a path on what they want to do post-retirement.

**Certifications Make All People More Employable**

Certifications are a way to demonstrate to employers that you have the skills and knowledge necessary to perform a specific job. They are a valuable addition to any resume and can make all people more employable. According to a study by CompTIA, 91% of employers believe that IT certifications are valuable in validating expertise. Additionally, 86% of hiring managers believe that certifications are a high priority when evaluating candidates. This means that getting a technical certificate can give you a competitive edge in the job market.

**Veterans Bring a Lot of Practical Skills to the Civilian Marketplace**

Military veterans bring a lot of practical skills to the civilian marketplace. They have experience in a variety of areas such as logistics, communications, and engineering. However, many veterans struggle to translate these skills into civilian terms. This is where certification training can be helpful. Certification training provides veterans with the documentation, knowledge, and skills necessary to perform a specific job in the civilian world. It also helps veterans translate their military experience into civilian terms hiring managers understand.

**Certification Training is One Way to Transition from Military Life**

Transitioning from military life to civilian life can be a challenge. Certification training is one way to ease this transition. There are many certification programs available that are specifically designed for veterans. These programs provide training in a variety of areas such as IT, healthcare, and manufacturing. They also provide veterans with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in their chosen field. This can be especially beneficial for veterans who may not have a lot of experience in the civilian world.

**Certification Training Helps Veterans Determine a Path on What They Want to Do Post-Retirement**

Certification training can also help veterans determine a path on what they want to do post-retirement. Many veterans struggle with finding a new purpose after leaving the military. Certification training can provide them with a new goal to work towards. It can also help them discover new interests and passions. Additionally, certification training can provide veterans with a sense of accomplishment and pride in their new field.

It is critical that the veteran choose which certifications match his career aspirations. There are trade certifications such as plumber, welder or electrician. Mike Rowe has effectively and regularly talked about the skilled trades on his podcast -- <https://mikerowe.com/tag/skilled-trades/>.

Some of the most popular certifications include AWS certifications, CSSP, CDPSE, CISM, CCIE, Certified Ethical Hacker, and Oracle. These certifications provide training in a variety of areas such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and database management. They are also recognized by many employers and can lead to high-paying jobs.
