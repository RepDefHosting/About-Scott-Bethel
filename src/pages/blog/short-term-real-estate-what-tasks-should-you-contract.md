If you're a real estate owner who wants to make the most of your property, renting it out as a short-term rental is a great option. Short-term rentals can bring in a lot of revenue, but they also require a lot of work. If you want to maximize your profits while minimizing the amount of time and effort you put into your rental property, it's important to know which tasks you should contract out to professionals. In this article, I'll explore the tasks that allow your property to be available to guests, those that will cause you to take a property offline, which tasks are time-consuming for the owner, which tasks require expertise such as plumbing, electrical, and structural, which tasks are required periodic maintenance, and how smart and flexible pricing can help keep guests happy.

**Determine What Tasks Allow Your Property to Be Available to Guests**

One of the most important tasks when renting out a short-term rental property is making sure that it's available to guests when they want to book it. This means that the property needs to be clean, well-maintained, and fully stocked with all of the necessary amenities. Some of the tasks that you should contract out to ensure that your property is available to guests include:

**Cleaning**

Cleaning your short-term rental property is a task that you should definitely contract out. A professional cleaning service will have the expertise and equipment necessary to get your property sparkling clean and ready for guests. They will also be able to clean your property quickly and efficiently, which is important if you have back-to-back bookings.

**Laundry**

If you're providing your guests with linens and towels, you'll need to have them cleaned after each guest checks out. This can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have multiple properties or a lot of bookings. Contracting out your laundry needs to a professional service can save you a lot of time and hassle.

**Restocking**

Your guests will expect your rental property to be fully stocked with essentials such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. Contracting out the task of restocking your property to a professional service can ensure that your guests always have what they need during their stay.

**Determine Which Tasks Will Cause You to Take a Property Offline**

While it's important to make sure that your property is available to guests, it's also important to know which tasks will cause you to take a property offline. This could be due to maintenance, repairs, or other issues that need to be addressed before the property can be rented out again. Some of the tasks that you should contract out to ensure that your property stays in good condition and doesn't need to be taken offline include:

**Plumbing**

Plumbing issues can be a major headache for short-term rental owners. If a guest reports a leak or other plumbing issue, it's important to get it fixed as soon as possible. Contracting out your plumbing needs to a professional can ensure that any issues are resolved quickly and efficiently.

**Electrical**

Electrical issues can also cause a property to be taken offline. If a guest reports an issue with the electrical system, it's important to have it addressed right away. Contracting out your electrical needs to a professional can ensure that any issues are resolved safely and effectively.

**Structural**

If there are any issues with the structural integrity of your property, it's important to have them addressed as soon as possible. Contracting out your structural needs to a professional can ensure that any issues are resolved safely and effectively, and can help prevent more serious issues from developing in the future.

**Conclusion**

Renting out a short-term rental property can be a great way to earn extra income, but it can also be a lot of work. By knowing which tasks to contract out and how to maximize your profits through smart pricing, you can make the most of your rental property without sacrificing your time or energy. Remember to contract out tasks that require expertise such as plumbing, electrical, and structural, and to keep up with periodic maintenance to ensure that your property stays in good condition. With the right strategy in place, you can enjoy all of the benefits of short-term rentals without any of the hassle.
